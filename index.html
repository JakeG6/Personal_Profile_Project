        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>I am on the path to become a full-fledged web developer. I've lived in various places, but I currently reside on the silicon slopes. I look forward to creating dynamic quality content on the web. It's hard work, but that's what makes it so worthwhile.</p>
        <p>My hobbies include exercise, graphic novels, East Asian cinema, and video games. Iâ€™ve worked previously in video production, especially motion graphics. It's a lot of fun, and I seek to expand my skills even further. "Ipsa scientia potestas est".</p>

        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <p>I want to be completely skilled in the world of web development, which currently includes:</p>
        <ul class="skills">
          <li>HTML</li>
          <li>CSS</li>
          <li>JavaScript</li>
          <li>Ruby</li>
          <li>Rails</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In the future I'd really love to learn additional languages like C# and Python. It'd be a blast to work full-time in design and development.</p>
